# ABM_ClimateAction
The Climate Action ABM is a simple agent-based model modelling the role of
climate activists, climate deniers and the power of influencers in a society.

CO2 emissions per capita depend on the agents state of mind (activists emit less
compared to the general population or climate deniers).
If a certain share of the population is climate-aware (activist state),
carbon removal technologies are used.

The global level of CO2 in the atmosphere starts at 410ppm. At a state of
1200ppm Earth System tipping points are reached and humanity ends.
